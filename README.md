# CODSOFT
Welcome to my GitHub repository, showcasing the tasks and projects completed during my 4-week virtual internship with CodSoft. 
This internship focuses on enhancing Python programming skills, where I successfully completed 5 hands-on tasks by the end of February 2025.
The tasks range from basic projects, such as a simple calculator, to intermediate-level projects, like a contact management system.
